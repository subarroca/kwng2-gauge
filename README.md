# ng-gauge
Flexible gauge graph made with SVG and Angular 5 that can be used as pie chart too.

As seen on Angularbeers http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Beers/events/234753624/



## Installing
ng-gauge is available via npm
```bash
npm install ng-gauge -S
```

Import GaugeModule in your module
```typescript
import { GaugeModule } from 'ng-gauge/dist';
```
And the models where you need them
```typescript
import { GaugeSegment, GaugeLabel } from 'ng-gauge/dist';
````


## Usage:
```html
<ng-gauge></ng-gauge>
```
Set a width and height for the gauge and it will scale accordingly.

Example code can be checked in `src/app/app.html` 


## Options:
* `rounded: boolean = true`          | whether linecap should be rounded
* `reverse: boolean = false`         | segments are sorted by value. whether drawing order should be sorted
* `animationSecs: number = 0.5`      | animation of lines when changing values
* `bgRadius: number = 100`           | radius of background circle
* `bgColor: string`                  | color of background circle
* `label: GaugeLabel[]`              | labels to be displayed
* `segments: GaugeSegment[]`         | info to be displayed

*GaugeSegment* is a class you *MUST* use and it has the following properties:
* `radius: number = 100`             | outer radius of this segment (border is painted inside)
* `goal: number = 100`               | maximum value for given segment
* `value: number`                    | value to be represented
* `color: string`                    | color of the segments
* `bgColor: string = 'transparent'`  | background color of this segment
* `borderWidth: number = 100`        | width of the border. Gets painted inside radius

*GaugeLabel* is a class you CAN use and it has the following properties:
* `color: string`                    | color of this label
* `text: string`                     | content of this label
* `x: number = 0`                    | x from starting point (center center)
* `y: number = 0`                    | y from starting point (center center)
* `fontSize: string = '1em'`         | font size of this label
